# Game of Life

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Running the project locally

`yarn install`: installs `node_modules`.

`yarn start`: runs the app on localhost.

`yarn test:e2e`: runs e2e tests only. Before running this script, there must be a running instance of the React app on localhost.

`yarn test`: runs all tests but e2e. Does not require a running instance of the app.

## Other scripts

Other scripts you can run from the project's root directory:

`yarn lint`: runs eslint to analyze code style. Use --fix option to fix errors that can be automatically fixed.
